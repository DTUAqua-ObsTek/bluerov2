# BlueROV2 ROS Simulation

## What is this Repository? ##

This repository contains the robot description and necessary launch files to simulate the BlueROV2 (unmanned underwater vehicle) on [Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Simulator (UUV Simulator)](https://github.com/uuvsimulator/uuv_simulator). It's also possible to simulate the BlueROV2 using [ArduSub Software-In-The-Loop](https://ardupilot.org/dev/docs/sitl-simulator-software-in-the-loop.html) with [mavros](http://wiki.ros.org/mavros) and other ROS packages. joystick interaction and video streaming capture with opencv based on  package from BlueRobotics.

This work consolidates the contributions from [Ingeniarius, Lda.](http://ingeniarius.pt/) and [Instituite of Systems and Robotics University of Coimbra](https://www.isr.uc.pt/) within the scope of MS thesis "Localization of an unmanned underwater vehicle using multiple water surface robots, multilateration, and sensor data fusion". Source code is derived from [bluerov_ros_playground](https://github.com/patrickelectric/bluerov_ros_playground).

The [Unmanned Underwater Vehicle Simulator](https://uuvsimulator.github.io/) (UUV-Sim) is also supported in this repository. The vehicle model generated at [bluerov2](https://github.com/fredvaz/bluerov2), has been adapted to work with Melodic relase of UUV-Sim

This repository is intended as introductory marine vehicle simulation software for the 2021 Spring Special Course "Autonomous Marine Robotics" hosted at the Technical University of Denmark.

## Getting Started ## 

The repository was built and tested on a fresh installation of Ubuntu 20.04. The [Getting Started Guide](GETTING_STARTED.md) will assist with installation of dependencies and testing. 
Tutorials [01](documentation/TUTORIAL-01.md) and [08](documentation/TUTORIAL-08.md) 
are intended for students enrolled in Autonomous Marine Robotics special course at DTU.
The [simulation tutorial](documentation/SIMULATION_TUTORIAL.md) gives a quick start guide for people interested in using the simulations.
